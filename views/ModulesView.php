          Daniel, put all of your test modules here. Make a CSS and JS file in the folder
          for each of your modules so that calling them is really easy. To get to this page,
          type http://localhost/form into the URL bar.
          
          In order to call all of the CSS, open public_html/SuperCSSLoader.php and add the
          filepaths to the list. With JS, open views/PageView.php and call them like I have.
